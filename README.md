# Rust and Redemption: A Text-Based Oddyssey

Rust and Redemption is an exciting text-based adventure game designed to be played in the terminal. It captures the essence of the classic 'choose-your-own-adventure' style, immersing players in a post-apocalyptic world filled with challenges, choices, and consequences.

## Game Overview

In Rust and Redemption, you'll embark on a perilous journey, where your decisions matter. With each scenario presented, you'll face critical choices that will significantly impact the outcome of your adventure. Will you survive in this harsh world and reach the end of the game?

## Technology Stack

- **MVC Architecture:** Our game is built upon a robust Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, ensuring a structured and organized codebase.

- **Handlebars:** We leverage Handlebars, a powerful templating engine, to create dynamic and engaging game content.

- **Express:** Our server is powered by Express, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, enabling smooth interactions between players and the game.

- **Node.js:** We utilize Node.js to bring our game to life, handling server-side logic and communication.
